Mini Machine Learning Project – Iris Flower Classification

This is a very simple machine learning project where I trained a model to identify different types of iris flowers based on their measurements.

What I did

Loaded the Iris dataset (built into scikit-learn)

Prepared the data (features + labels)

Trained a simple model (Logistic Regression)

Tested the model using accuracy score

Visualized results using a confusion matrix

Goal

Learn the basic steps of a machine learning workflow:
load → train → test → visualize

Result

The model achieved around 95%+ accuracy on the test data.

Tools Used

Python

scikit-learn

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn
What I Learned
